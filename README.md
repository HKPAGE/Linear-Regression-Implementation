<h1>Simple and Multiple Linear Regression Implementation and Comparison</h1>
<p>This project is designed to be an introduction to the concepts of Simple and Multiple Linear Regressions. I implemented both of these models from scratch in python using just numpy arrays and methods for the actual calculations, and I did not use any machine learning libraries such as pytorch, keras, sklearn, etc. This project taught me a lot about the actual math behind both simple and multipl elinear regressions, which is important to understanding and being able to think critically about models in the real world. I learned LaTeX, as I wanted all of the math visuals to be created myself, and I also learned how to use matplotlib (pyplot specifically) to visualize the performance of both of my models.</p>
